Welcome to the Web Framework Vulnerabilities room! In this interactive and hands-on environment, you will explore common vulnerabilities found in modern web applications built on popular web frameworks. Throughout this room, you'll gain practical experience in identifying and exploiting critical security flaws, which are essential for any aspiring penetration tester or cybersecurity enthusiast.

Key Learning Objectives:
Session Modification:

Understand the concept of session management in web applications.
Learn how to exploit session fixation and session hijacking vulnerabilities.
Modify session variables to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
SQL Injection:

Dive into SQL injection attacks, one of the most prevalent web vulnerabilities.
Learn how to identify SQL injection points in applications using various techniques.
Practice crafting and executing malicious SQL queries to extract sensitive data from databases.
DOM-Based XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):

Explore the principles of DOM-based XSS and its impact on web security.
Discover how malicious scripts can be injected into web pages via client-side manipulation.
Gain hands-on experience in exploiting DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities and understand how to mitigate them.
JWT Authentication:

Learn about JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and their role in modern web application authentication.
Understand common vulnerabilities associated with improper JWT implementation, including token forgery and manipulation.
Practice exploiting vulnerabilities in JWT-based authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to protected resources.
What You Will Gain:
By the end of this room, you will have a solid understanding of how these vulnerabilities operate within web frameworks and how to exploit them effectively. This knowledge will empower you to better secure your own applications and recognize weaknesses in existing systems.

Get ready to sharpen your skills and dive deep into the world of web application security!
